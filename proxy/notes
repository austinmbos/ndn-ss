tests to perform




1. put into docker last


2. producer recieves interest`
	a. writes out data to file

3. micro service chain takes over here
	a. decrypt
	b. verify sig ( fake, just pretend its bad sig )
	c. request final data ( just make up some fake data if success )






Each container will read their own semaphore file. From this, they well
determine to procede, or to busy wait/poll. all semaphore files will start 
with a 1, meaning busy, or wait. Once a procedure is done, modify to a 0 so the
next service knows it is free and can procede.



the producer.cpp application, before it returns a data packets, should wait for
its own semaphore to release. Once it release, the application can return a data
packet.
